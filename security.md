## Access Controls 

Access to all internal systems is protected by multi-factor authentication. All application and user access logs are stored centrally and monitored. No employee can access user information unless explicitly authorized by the user.

## Infrastructure 

* All production systems are hosted on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
* Multi-factor authentication is required on all accounts that have access to production systems.
